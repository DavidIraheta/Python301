Patch observing the landing of troops and supplies

The Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse took place from 15 December 1942 to 23 January 1943 and was primarily an engagement between United States and Imperial Japanese forces in the hills near the Matanikau River on Guadalcanal during the Guadalcanal campaign. The U.S. forces were under the overall command of Major General Alexander Patch (pictured), and the Japanese under the overall command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake. U.S. soldiers and Marines, assisted by native Solomon Islanders, attacked Imperial Japanese Army forces defending well-entrenched positions on several hills and ridges. With difficulty the U.S. succeeded in taking Mount Austen, in the process reducing a strongly defended position called the Gifu, as well as the Galloping Horse and the Sea Horse. In the meantime, the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal and withdrew; most of the surviving Japanese troops were successfully evacuated. (This article is part of a featured topic: Guadalcanal Campaign.)

Daniel Risch

General elections in Liechtenstein have been held since the ratification of the 1862 constitution, in which the Landtag of Liechtenstein was established. Political parties did not exist in Liechtenstein until they were formed in 1918. Before the ratification of the 1921 constitution, the head of government was appointed by the prince of Liechtenstein; elections were thus held only to elect members of the Landtag. Under the current constitution, general elections are held to elect members of the Landtag, who then elect the prime minister of Liechtenstein. Forty-eight general elections have been held in Liechtenstein, most recently in 2021, which resulted in Daniel Risch (pictured) becoming prime minister. The 2025 general election is scheduled to take place on 9 February. (Full list...)

Today's featured picture







The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The core lineup of the band comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. Widely regarded as the most influential band of all time, they were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting, and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionized many aspects of the music industry and were often publicized as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements. This photograph shows the Beatles – from left to right, Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr – waving to a crowd of fans after arriving at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City on 7 February 1964, at the start of their first visit to the United States. Their visit marked the beginning of the British Invasion, a cultural phenomenon of the mid-1960s when rock and pop-music acts from the United Kingdom and other aspects of British culture became popular in the United States. The band's widespread popularity and the intense reception that greeted them was termed "Beatlemania".
