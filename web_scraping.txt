Stanley Green (1915–1993) was a sandwich man who became a well-known figure in London during the latter part of the 20th century. For 25 years Green patrolled Oxford Street, carrying a placard that advocated "Less Lust, By Less Protein: Meat Fish Bird; Egg Cheese; Peas Beans; Nuts. And Sitting", with the wording and punctuation changing over the years. Arguing that protein made people lustful and aggressive, his solution was "protein wisdom", a low-protein diet for "better, kinder, happier people". For a few pence, passers-by could buy his 14-page pamphlet, Eight Passion Proteins with Care, which reportedly sold 87,000 copies over 20 years. He became one of London's much-loved eccentrics, though his campaign was not invariably popular, leading to two arrests for obstruction and the need to wear green overalls to protect himself from spit. When he died at the age of 78, his pamphlets, placards, and letters were passed to the Museum of London. (Full article...)

Today's featured picture






A Sensation Novel is a comic musical play in three acts (described as "volumes" in the programme), one of a series written by the dramatist W. S. Gilbert for the Royal Gallery of Illustration, with music composed by Thomas German Reed, though much of the music is lost. The play premiered on 31 January 1871 and concerns an author suffering from writer's block who finds that the characters in his novel are dissatisfied when they come to life and complain about their fate. The piece satirises the sensation novels popular as pulp detective fiction in the Victorian era. This lithographic poster was designed by Robert Jacob Hamerton to advertise the premiere of A Sensation Novel.
