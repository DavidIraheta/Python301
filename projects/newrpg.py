# use OOP techniques to create a text-based command-line interface role-playing game.
#Build a text-based role-playing game that has at least two classes:
#Hero(): the protagonist of your game that the player controls and identifies with. There should be only one hero.
#Opponent(): the challengers that the player meets throughout the gameplay. There should be multiple opponents.
#The hero should encounter multiple opponents of different strengths or levels. They should be able to perform different actions when meeting an opponent.
# These actions should be at a minimum: attack or run away
#If the Hero chooses to attack, the program decides through a simulated dice throw that takes the current level into account whether the hero or the opponent wins this round:
#Also, implement consequences for winning and losing, e.g., forcing the hero to wait a few seconds before continuing the game in case they lose. 
# Or removing the opponent from the opponent pool in case the hero wins.
# You'll have to implement both attributes and methods for both of your classes. Think about what you'll need so you can model the described functionality
